Docker
-----------
Docker is containerization software which is most valuable for software developers, operators and enterprises. Because it is very easy to 
build and run app on different deployment environments.

Docker Image is a class.
Docker Container is the object or instance of a particular Docker Image



list all working and exited images
----------------------------------
docker images -a  




delete existing image (--force flag for forcing running image)
----------------------------------
docker rmi --force <imageId>



list all working and exited containers
--------------------------------------
docker ps -a 




delete existing container
----------------------------------
docker rm --force <containerId>




To run container first container 
----------------------------------
docker run hello-world

**above code will make container from a image which is located on locally or if not on docker hub
but it will create random name for that container 




To give our own name for the container
-----------------------------------------
docker run --name <your-name> <image-name>
**if need to run container background we can use -d flag




To make ubuntu container and go directly to inside of the container 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
docker run -it --name my-linux-container ubuntu bash

**now you are in inside of the buntu container and you can execute all the linux commands on it 





To remove all exited docker containers from locally
------------------------------------------------------
docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q)







To start and stop existing container
------------------------------------------
docker start <container-name>
docker stop <container-name>




To execute any command on running container
-----------------------------------------------
docker exec -it tharusha-ubuntu-lamp bash




To make a image from container 
----------------------------------
1 option 
	- docker commit <container-id> <new-image-name>
2 option 
	- docker commit <container-id>
	**above command will make new image to docker but without name
	- docker tag <newly-created-image-id> <new-name>



To pull image from docker hub
---------------------------------
docker pull <username>/<image-name>





To push that image to docker hub
-----------------------------------------------
**login
docker login

**tag a docker image
docker tag <image-id> <username>/<new-image-name>

**push image to docker hub
docker push <username>/<new-image-name>






To build our own docker image 
-----------------------------------
**first navigate to a folder 
**make file called "Dockerfile" without any extension
---------------------------
FROM ubuntu
CMD echo "Welcome Tharusha"
--------------------------

**then run this command on directory 

docker build -t <new-image-name> .

**then you can run container from that image 







Docker-compose
----------------------------------------------
Up to now we build and run only one service but if someone needs to run multiple micro services at one time
we have option called docker-compose which can build and run multiple containers at onece

->install docker-compose
	- sudo apt-get install docker-compose

->create docker-compose.yml file on directory contains as below
	# Docker Version: 1.13.0
	# Docker Compose Version: 1.10.1

	version: "3"

	services:
    		web1:
        		image: dockercloud/hello-world
        		container_name: web1
        		ports:
           			- "81:80"

    		web2:
        		image: dockercloud/hello-world
        		container_name: web2
        		ports:
            			- "82:80"

->Go to that directory, open terminal and execute this command
	- docker-compose up

->go to localhost:81 and localhost:82 and see
**above two containers are run as web servers and all two servers have up their localhost:80 as internally 
  and exported as localhost:81 and localhost:82 in host machine
